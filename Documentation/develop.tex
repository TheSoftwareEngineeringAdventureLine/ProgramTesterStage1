\chapter{Development Environment}
Since the program was to test files on a Linux enviornment, it was developed
on a Linux enviornment.


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
No special Tools or IDE were used to develop this.  Since the code was so simple
each programmer just used what ever coding enviornment they wanted.  All
the code was tested on a Linux machine using the g++ compiler.  The debug tool
gdb was used to debug the code when necessary.

\section{Source  Control}
We used github for source control.  The repository can be found at this url:

\section{Dependencies}
This program is dependent on the C++ Standard Library as well as the g++ compiler
on a Linux system.

\section{Build  Environment}
The execuatble is built by the g++ compiler.  You can either compile it manually, using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
g++ -o tester ProgramTester.cpp
\end{lstlisting}
Or by using the following make file:

\begin{lstlisting}
# compiler
CC = g++

# compiler options
CFLAGS = -c -Wall

all: tester

tester: tester.o
	$(CC) -lm tester.o -o ProgramTester

tester.o: ProgramTester.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) ProgramTester.cpp

clean:
	rm -rf *o tester
\end{lstlisting}
