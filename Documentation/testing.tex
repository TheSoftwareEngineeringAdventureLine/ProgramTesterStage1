\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

The approach taken to testing was a very simple process due to the simplistic nature
of the program itself, as such not much detail will be provided.

\section{Overview}
Before each part is pushed up to the repository the programmer would test it and
ensure that it was functioning the way they intended it to function.  After each
individual part was pushed up a main function was written to do the overall
algorithm, little tweaks were made to each function so that they would work
together properly, but no large changes to the algorithm.



\section{Dependencies}
All of the tests depend on the g++ compiler, and linux platform.  The code needs
to compile a C++ file inorder to run and test that file.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
Test cases were given to us by Dr. Logar.  Each one was tested and then we went through 
and manually looked at the .ans and .out files to make sure that the result in the .log file
matched with what we would actually determine the answer to be by looking ourselves.
